# 📚 Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples  

This repository demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python using **Books & Animals** as examples.  

## 📝 Features  

### **1. Book & Textbook Classes**  
- `Book`: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, genre, and page count.  
- `Textbook`: Inherits from `Book` and includes a subject and edition.  
- Methods include:  
  - `read(pages)`: Simulates reading a book.  
  - `bookmark(page)`: Saves progress at a specific page.  
  - `get_status()`: Returns whether the book is completed or in progress.  

### **2. Animal Hierarchy (Polymorphism & Inheritance)**  
- `Animal` (Abstract Class) – Defines a base structure for all animals.  
- Subclasses (`Dog`, `Fish`, `Bird`, `Snake`) implement:  
  - `move()`: Describes how the animal moves.  
  - `speak()`: Defines what the animal says.
